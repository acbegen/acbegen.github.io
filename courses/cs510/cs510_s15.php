		<h2>Course Overview</h2>
		<strong>Description: </strong>The objective of this course is to introduce
		the key concepts involved with networked entertainment. This includes
		concepts in generating, delivering and consuming multimedia content. The
		course will briefly explain the theory and principles in coding,
		packaging and securing multimedia data, while mostly focusing on the
		methods for reliable and scalable transport over IP networks in the
		context of IPTV, video-on-demand and streaming applications. The course
		will also present the best practices in network and operating system
		support for media transport, and the state-of-the-art in current
		deployments. <br><strong>Intended Audience:</strong> Senior/graduate engineering students
		are welcome to take this course. <br><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Having
		a solid computer
		networking knowledge and programming skills is strongly recommended as
		we will build on top of the basic networking concepts. If
		you have successfully completed CS 421, it will suffice.
